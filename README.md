# 📊 Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analytics portfolio.  
Here you'll find a collection of personal and academic projects demonstrating my skills in data analysis, data visualization, and business intelligence.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a passionate data enthusiast with experience in:

- SQL and relational databases  
- Python for data manipulation and visualization (Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Excel for structured data analysis  
- Tableau for interactive dashboards and storytelling  
- Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory analysis and documentation

I’m currently seeking opportunities in the field of Data/Business Analytics.

- SQL queries
- Tableau dashboards (linked or exported)
- Project summaries in PDF or Markdown format
