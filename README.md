# 📊 Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analytics portfolio.  
Here you'll find a collection of personal and academic projects demonstrating my skills in data analysis, data visualization, and business intelligence.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

- SQL and relational databases  
- Python for data manipulation and visualization (Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Excel for structured data analysis  
- Tableau for interactive dashboards and storytelling
